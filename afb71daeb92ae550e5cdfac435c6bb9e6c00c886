Our dependencies are already long and more complicated than they would be ideally.  BUILD_BROKEN_DUP_RULES is already enabled on pretty much every device and it would probably be best/easiest to just enable it on your devices as well.  Otherwise, we can either look at making roomservice more modular or just fix the errors.",
